# IFAS Online UI – React.js + CSS Modules

This repository contains a **complete UI-only implementation** of the IFAS Online website (Assessment Task), built using **React.js** with **CSS Modules**. The UI closely matches the provided Figma design and visuals, with full responsiveness across devices.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this task was to create static UI sections based on a design reference. The UI is structured into multiple reusable components with scoped styling using CSS Modules. This project does **not** include backend logic — it is a pure front-end implementation with dummy/static content.
